# Day_021-Bivariate/Multivariate
Bivariate analysis is stated to be an analysis of any concurrent relation between two variables or attributes. This study explores the relationship of two variables as well as the depth of this relationship to figure out if there are any discrepancies between two variables and any causes of this difference. Some of the examples are percentage table, scatter plot, etc.

## Types of Bivariate Analysis
The various types of bivariate analysis are:
```
1. Scatter Plots
2. Correlation Analysis
3. Regression Analysis
4. Chi-Square Test
5. T-tests and ANOVA
```

## Types of Bivariate Analysis on variable
- **Numerical and Numerical:**  In this type, both the variables of bivariate data, independent and dependent, are having numerical values.
- **Categorical and Categorical:**  When both the variables are categorical.
- **Numerical and Categorical:**  When one variable is numerical and one is categorical.

## There some plot for Bivariate/Multivariate
```
1. Scatterplot (Numerical - Numerical)
2. Bar Plot (Numerical - Categorical)
3. Box Plot (Numerical - Categorical)
4. Distplot (Numerical - Categorical)
5. HeatMap (Categorical - Categorical)
6. ClusterMap (Categorical - Categorical)
7. Pairplot
8. Lineplot (Numerical - Numerical)
```
