## 🧭 My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to the documentation of my machine learning journey! This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my transition from a beginner to a confident practitioner in traditional Machine Learning, marking my first major step toward mastering **Generative AI**.

This repository is not just a collection of code —
it is a **story of consistency, curiosity, struggle, and growth**.

I started learning **Machine Learning** on
📅 **February 8, 2025 (Saturday)** at **8:58 PM**

At that time, I had one clear thought in my mind:

> *“Before jumping into Generative AI, I must understand the foundations properly.”*

That thought became the beginning of this journey.

After months of learning, practicing, failing, debugging, and learning again,
I finally completed this tutorial on
📅 **December 18, 2025 (Thursday)** at **10:09 AM**.

This repository represents **every step I took during that time**.

## 📅 The Timeline

* **Start Date:** February 8, 2025 (Saturday, 8:58 PM)
* **Completion Date:** December 18, 2025 (Thursday, 10:09 AM)
* **Status:** 🎉 Completed & Paused

## 💡 Why I Created This Repository

I created this repository to:

* Build **strong fundamentals of traditional Machine Learning**
* Learn concepts **deeply, not just superficially**
* Practice consistently and document my progress
* Prepare myself **step by step** for **Generative AI**

This was my **first serious commitment** to Machine Learning, and I stayed consistent with it for months.

## 📖 Journey Overview

This repository contains the code, notes, and implementations I developed over several months of intensive learning. My goal was to build a rock-solid foundation in traditional ML before diving into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

Throughout this journey, I explored the mathematical intuition, data preprocessing techniques, and various algorithms that power modern AI. Completing this has given me the confidence to take the next step in my career as an AI developer.

### Key Concepts Covered:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing patterns and cleaning messy data.
* **Supervised Learning:** Regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) and Classification (Logistic, SVM, Decision Trees).
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA).
* **Ensemble Techniques:** Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).
* **Model Evaluation:** Precision-Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Cross-Validation.

## 🧠 What I Learned Along the Way

Throughout this journey, I explored most of the **core concepts of traditional Machine Learning**, including:

### 🔹 Foundations

* Python for Machine Learning
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Data cleaning, preprocessing & feature engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Supervised Learning

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning

* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 🔹 Model Evaluation & Practical Skills

* Train/Test Split & Cross Validation
* Bias–Variance Tradeoff
* Model performance metrics
* Overfitting vs Underfitting
* Working with real-world datasets

Each concept here didn’t just teach me *how* things work —
it taught me **why they work**.

## 📂 How This Repository Is Organized

The repository is structured in a **simple and progressive way**, mostly following my daily learning path:

```
100-Days-of-Machine-Learning/
│
├── Day-01/
├── Day-02/
├── ...
├── Projects/
├── Notes/
└── Resources/
```

Inside each folder, you’ll find:

* Concept explanations
* Code implementations
* Practice notebooks
* Experiments and observations from my learning

## 🏁 Current Status

✅ **Completed & Paused**

This repository is **paused intentionally**.

I have completed **almost all the important core concepts of traditional Machine Learning**, and at this stage, there is **no major fundamental concept left to cover** here.

Rather than adding things unnecessarily, I decided to **close this chapter properly**.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next?

As I have completed the most important concepts of traditional machine learning, this repository is now **paused**.

My next focus will be:

1. **Deep Learning Foundations** (Neural Networks, PyTorch/TensorFlow).
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
3. **Generative AI & LLMs** (The ultimate goal of this journey!).

---

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

This journey taught me one powerful lesson:

> **Consistency matters more than motivation.**

Some days were exciting.
Some days were confusing.
Some days I wanted to quit.

But I kept going — and that made all the difference.

This repository will always remind me that **progress is built one day at a time**.
