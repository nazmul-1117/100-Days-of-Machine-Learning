# Day_019-Asking Basic Question to your Dataset

**Basic questions asked about a dataset in machine learning often focus on its features, data types, distribution, missing values, outliers, relationships between features, and whether it's suitable for the intended machine learning task**

### Some Common Question
- **Data types**  What are the data types of each feature (numerical, categorical, text, etc.)? 
- **Feature distribution:** How are the features distributed (normal, skewed, bimodal)? 
- **Missing values:** Are there any missing values in the dataset, and how prevalent are they? 
- **Outliers:** Are there any outliers present in the data, and how should they be handled? 
- **Feature correlations:** Are there any strong correlations between features? 
- **Class balance (for classification tasks):** If performing classification, is the target variable balanced across classes? 
- **Feature scaling:** Do features need to be scaled before applying machine learning algorithms? 
- **Data quality:** Is the data clean and consistent? 

### Further questions depending on the specific machine learning task might include:
- **Target variable:** What is the target variable, and what is its data type? 
- **Dimensionality:** Is the dataset high-dimensional, and if so, what dimensionality reduction techniques might be needed? 
- **Data collection method:** How was the data collected, and are there potential biases introduced during collection? 
- **Data cleaning steps:** What data cleaning procedures were performed on the dataset? 
- **Feature engineering:** What feature engineering techniques could be applied to improve model performance?

### 5 questions to ask yourself before working with a dataset
```
1. How was the data compiled? 
2. Is the data accurate? 
3. Is the data clean?
4. How much data should you have?
5. Remember why: what problem do you want to tackle?
```
