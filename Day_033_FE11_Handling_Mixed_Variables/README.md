# Day_033-Handling Mixed Variables in single column

Handling mixed variables involves working with both numerical and categorical data in the same dataset. This can be challenging because different types of variables may require different handling techniques. 

## Steps for handling mixed variables 
1. Identify numerical and categorical columns
2. Split data into numerical and categorical columns
3. Preprocess the data
4. Use feature engineering to create meaningful features
5. Select an appropriate model
6. Validate the model

## Example
For example, if a column contains both numbers and text, you can split the data into two columns. One column can store the numerical data and the other can store the categorical data. 

## Additional tips
- `Date and time` variables are particularly important to - handle correctly. 
- Mixed variables can impact the accuracy and - performance of models. 
- You can use Python with pandas and scikit-learn to - preprocess mixed data. 
- You can use FAMD, a generalization of the Principal - Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, to cluster mixed datasets.

When you have a list like `[1, 5, 6, 'A', 7, 9, 'K']` or `['A75', 'B56', 'C89']`, Pandas (and many other data analysis tools) will often infer the data type of the entire column as object. This is a general data type that can hold strings, numbers, or even other Python objects.  However, this can limit what you can do with your data.

## Why Extract Data Types?
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** To effectively clean and prepare your data for analysis or machine learning, you need to know the true data types of your variables. For example:

    + If you want to perform mathematical operations, you need numerical data.
    + If you want to use certain machine learning models, you might need to convert categorical data into numerical representations.
    + If you want to analyze text, you need to identify string variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Understanding data types helps you create new, more informative features. For instance, you might want to extract numerical parts from strings like 'A75' or create dummy variables for different categories.

- **Data Validation:** Checking the data types helps ensure that your data is in the expected format. This can help you catch errors early on.

- **Model Compatibility:** Many machine learning algorithms have specific data type requirements. Knowing the data types helps you choose the right models and preprocessing techniques.

## How to Extract and Handle Mixed Data Types
The best way to handle mixed data types depends on your specific goals. Here are some common approaches:

## 1. If the goal is to separate numbers and letters:

- **Identify:** Use string methods like isdigit() or regular expressions to identify which elements are numbers and which are letters.
- **Separate:** Create new columns for numbers and letters.
- **Convert:** Convert the numerical column to the appropriate numerical type (e.g., int, float).
  
```python
import pandas as pd

data = [1, 5, 6, 'A', 7, 9, 'K']
df = pd.DataFrame({'mixed_data': data})

df['numbers'] = df['mixed_data'].apply(lambda x: x if isinstance(x, (int, float)) else None)
df['letters'] = df['mixed_data'].apply(lambda x: x if isinstance(x, str) else None)

df['numbers'] = pd.to_numeric(df['numbers'])  # Convert to numeric type

print(df)
```

## 2. If the goal is to extract numerical parts from strings:
- **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to extract the numerical parts from strings like `A75`, `B56`, `C89`.
- **Convert:** Convert the extracted parts to numerical types.
  
```python
import pandas as pd
import re

data = ['A75', 'B56', 'C89']
df = pd.DataFrame({'mixed_data': data})

df['numbers'] = df['mixed_data'].str.extract(r'(\d+)')  # Extract digits
df['numbers'] = pd.to_numeric(df['numbers'])  # Convert to numeric

print(df)
```

## 3. If the goal is to treat the data as categorical:
** Convert to String:** Convert all elements to strings if they are not already.
** Categorical Encoding:** Use one-hot encoding or other categorical encoding techniques if you're working with machine learning models that require numerical input.
```python
import pandas as pd

data = [1, 5, 6, 'A', 7, 9, 'K']
df = pd.DataFrame({'mixed_data': data})

df['mixed_data'] = df['mixed_data'].astype(str)  # Convert all to strings

print(df)
```
