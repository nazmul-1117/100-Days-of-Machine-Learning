#  Day_018 Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of using software to automatically extract data from websites. It's also known as web harvesting or web data extraction

## How it works
```
1. A web scraper visits a website 
2. It extracts the HTML code and data stored in the database 
3. The data is saved in a local file 
4. The data is parsed and filtered for useful information 
5. The data is used for various purposes, such as business intelligence, market research, and price monitoring 
```

## Use cases 
- **Price monitoring:** Track product prices, stock, and performance
- **Lead generation:** Collect contact information from various websites
- **Market research:** Gather data to make business decisions
- **Sentiment analysis:** Collect data from social media to understand how consumers feel about products
- **E-commerce:** Extract product data, prices, descriptions, and images
